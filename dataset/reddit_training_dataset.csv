reply,cgoq6kj,"Ah yes, Marshall's study on combat fire ratios. The answer is: no one knows. There's a lot of elosions and confusions during war, keep in mind % of all casualties in WWII was from friendly fire ^ over the years this decreased as our forces became more organized or alternatively the enemies after WWII we fought were less and less organized then the Axis . Many people have cried bullshit at his studies, his studies were poorly documented, were based on after action interviews, and said things like ""Brennan’s account also reinforces the contention of critics of Marshall’s use of statistics, who conclude that Marshall was unscientific in his methodology and that his figures about the percentage of troops firing their weapons were either sloppy, fabricated, or simply guesswork. ... Nevertheless, unlike the recollection of the Army captain who accompanied Marshall in Europe in World War II that he could not recall Marshall ever asking who had fired his weapon, Brennan does recall the journalist occasionally asking that question directly in his interviews in Korea."" ^1 I would like to mention a scene in Maus, the comic book / biography in which the author's father is ordered to fire his weapon, so he blindly fires it, partly because he's unwilling to take another life although later he does kill a German soldier . ^3 In a google search I just made, somewhere between ,000 to ,000 rounds were eended per kill in Vietnam. That is because of suppressive fire. But I must say that it's hard to figure out the motivations for suppressive fire, it could be caused by combat stress or opposing enemy suppressive fire causing soldiers to , or it could be a result of a psychological factor that results in people to avoid aiming directly at an enemy few people want to kill another person . I also would like to say it's pretty unlikely for soldiers to admit in front of their comrades that they didn't even attempt to kill an enemy. Unfortunately nothing is certain in war, maybe when we attach cameras to the guns of soldiers we could get a better glimpse, but even then... nothing is certain. I apologize that this post falls a little short of the standards of this subreddit, but this question is probably better asked in r/military/ or r/asksocialscience/ . On a final note, Marshall's statistics was part of the reason for the adoption of the M16, it was felt that automatic weapons would allow soldiers who typically don't fire their weapons to blind fire their weapons through suppressive fire.

Marshall's findings, reported in Men Against Fire and other places: &gt;The thing is simply this, that out of an average men along the line of fire during the period of an encounter, only men on average would take any part with the weapons. This was true whether the action was spread over a day, or two days or three...In the most aggressive infantry companies, under the most intense local pressure, the figure rarely rose above % of total strength from the opening to the close of an action. And &gt;It is therefore reasonable to believe that the average and healthy individual--the man who can endure the mental and physical stresses of combat--still has such an inner and usually unrealized resistance towards killing a fellow man that he will not of his own volition take life if it is possible to turn away from that responsibility...At the vital point he becomes a conscientious objector... Marshall's conclusions have not gone unchallenged, and are still discussed today. [Apparently his methods were not very rigorous or scientific] , and there's lots of reasons for a soldier to not fire his weapon, even in a close engagement with the enemy. Do keep in mind that the weapons of the time were powerful enough to make even a fleeting and momentary glimpse of the enemy a good opportunity for a kill. These weren't firing lines yards apart. Even an earnest killer might not have abundant opportunities of actually shooting someone. Still, after WWII they led to innovations in training to increase rate of fire.",6,0,3,
reply,cgoq9oi,"This claim comes from 'Man Against Fire' by S.L.A. Marshall, who was a US Army historian for WW2. He's fairly controversial, as is the book, and the %-20% figure comes from his book, although it's misquoted. For one, he's basing it off interviews he did, which isn't exactly a good piece of evidence. Also, it's more specific then is stated. Only -20% of *American riflemen* fired their *personal* weapons *at an eed enemy soldier*. This makes the statistic a lot more understandable, because it excludes crew-served weapons machine guns , and key weapons flamethrowers . While his numbers were initially accepted and frequently quoted, they've been called into question several times. One of the larger things I've seen pointed out in rebuttals of his statistics is that it fails to distinguish between soldiers who *can* fire, and shoulders who *should* fire. A medic has a sidearm. Should he be firing at an eed soldier, or should he be doing his normal duties? What about squad leaders, more focused on directing the battle then taking shots themselves? [This] is an excellent breakdown of why his methods were called into question, and includes an interview by the man who accompanied him through his interviews in the Korean war which came up with a % fire rate . Some sample issues with his work include that he didn't interview casualties, only unharmed men who were still ready for action, that he didn't take into account things like weapons jamming, and that his numbers were based more on guesses then anything else. It wasn't a proper survey even, but instead a group discussion he'd pull information out of. Simply put... it's just not very good history. It's hard to get a proper number for how many soldiers fired their guns, but the -20% is more or less impossible to back up, and completely ignores several significant factors.",36,0,3,
reply,cgoz2di,"It's also talking about ""at an eed enemy soldier"". Meaning that pointing in the general direction of the enemy doesn't count. But, per an earlier comment, the soldier can still be firing their weapon and therefore using up ammunition and causing wear on their gun barrel.",2,0,3,
reply,cgoqevd,"That claim is based on the books ""On Killing: The Psychological Cost of Learning to Kill in War and Society"", by David Grossman; and ""Men against Fire"", by SLA Marshall. I'll get my bias out here - I think this idea is crap, and the basic reason is that extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence, and there is no evidence to support that claim. Marshall's work, wherein he makes the claim that % of soldiers do not fire on the enemy, was based on post-combat interviews with soldiers, but no record of any questions about the ratio of fire exists. In fact, the only record of his interviews at all besides his books , makes mention of soldiers firing weapons, but nothing whatsoever that could support a hard number of how many men fired or did not fire. There is no evidence of statistical analysis based on his interviews, no records of questions about whether soldiers fired or not, no questions about ammunition consumption. There is no evidence from quartermasters about ammunition consumption, barrel wear, or any other secondary evidence. So this number is one that Marshall may have arrived at honestly, but there is simply no evidence to support it. If you're interested, Robert Engen wrote a very incisive article on the subject in the Canadian Military Journal, and wrote his Masters thesis on the subject. Engen found and has the evidence to prove that - for Canadians, at the very least - did not have this problem. Based on primary sources written post-combat interviews with Canadian officers , he found *exactly the opposite* of what Marshall and Grossman claim. Canadian officers found that their forces fire was very effective, and, if anything, their men fired *too much*! So - there's no evidence to support this claim, and there is primary source evidence that it is BS. If you'd like to read Engen's article in the CMJ or his thesis, here they are: In the interest of a little balance, Grossman makes a in my opinion very feeble defense of his work and Marshall's in the CMJ as well:",183,0,2,
reply,cgot99h,"*Acts of War* by Richard Holmes also references Marshall's work and is in turn referenced by Grossman. I think Holmes presents a far more rounded view of the infantry soldier's eerience and does a much better job of analysing why soldiers fight or not and the effect that it has on them. It is full of examples of counter-intuitive behaviour and emphasises that once battle is joined the situation is so chaotic that typical predictions of human behaviour do not hold true. Who would have thought that a large number of Argentinian soldiers at Goose Green would have responded to bombardment by getting into their sleeping bags? The major problems with this whole subject area is that there is not a continuous stream of armed actions which can be directly observed by psychologists and, in common with the majority of social research, it is impossible to control for the relevant variables: &gt; ""Everyone stop! OK, now I want Smoggins to stand up and let’s see if Gruber over there fires at him."" Almost everything in this area is laced with bias. Soldiers don't want to be seen as cowards, commanders want to believe their men are good fighters, very few people understand what battle is actually like, very few psychologists are soldiers, very few soldiers are psychologists and it is very rare to find scholars with relevant military eerience who can combine academic rigour in both history and psychology. *On the Psychology of Military Incompetence* by Norman Din is a good example: Din was a Major in the Royal Engineers and an esteemed psychologist, but the historical section of his book is extremely suspect - especially his treatment of World War One. Against this backdrop I see Marshall's and Grossman's works as important contributions to a poorly studied area in which no one can produce any definitive research. What is not in any doubt is that western militaries have gone to great lengths since the end of World War Two to develop sophisticated, realistic training environments to prepare soldiers for battle and develop instinctive responses to stimuli: in effect to stop the soldier from thinking.",52,0,2,

reply,cgot99h,"*Acts of War* by Richard Holmes also references Marshall's work and is in turn referenced by Grossman. I think Holmes presents a far more rounded view of the infantry soldier's eerience and does a much better job of analysing why soldiers fight or not and the effect that it has on them. It is full of examples of counter-intuitive behaviour and emphasises that once battle is joined the situation is so chaotic that typical predictions of human behaviour do not hold true. Who would have thought that a large number of Argentinian soldiers at Goose Green would have responded to bombardment by getting into their sleeping bags? The major problems with this whole subject area is that there is not a continuous stream of armed actions which can be directly observed by psychologists and, in common with the majority of social research, it is impossible to control for the relevant variables: &gt; ""Everyone stop! OK, now I want Smoggins to stand up and let’s see if Gruber over there fires at him."" Almost everything in this area is laced with bias. Soldiers don't want to be seen as cowards, commanders want to believe their men are good fighters, very few people understand what battle is actually like, very few psychologists are soldiers, very few soldiers are psychologists and it is very rare to find scholars with relevant military eerience who can combine academic rigour in both history and psychology. *On the Psychology of Military Incompetence* by Norman Din is a good example: Din was a Major in the Royal Engineers and an esteemed psychologist, but the historical section of his book is extremely suspect - especially his treatment of World War One. Against this backdrop I see Marshall's and Grossman's works as important contributions to a poorly studied area in which no one can produce any definitive research. What is not in any doubt is that western militaries have gone to great lengths since the end of World War Two to develop sophisticated, realistic training environments to prepare soldiers for battle and develop instinctive responses to stimuli: in effect to stop the soldier from thinking.",52,0,3,

There's also the fundamental role that it plays in ""fire and maneuver"" tactics.

reply,chfogbk,"Actually, he is right, kind of. Though nicotine can have bad side effects in excess as almost all drugs, including caffeine and is very addictive roughly as addictive as morphine the main health problems associated with smoking concern the build up of carcinogens and various oxidants that cause a myriad of physiological damage that would take me a few hours to type out comprehensively. Nicotine itself is not considered carcinogenic, which is why nicotine therapies like a patch are favored over cigarette use. It gives the person the nicotine fix albeit, less effective than inhaling without loading down your body with the huge list of added chemicals in cigarettes. Is nicotine good for you? No, its not. It can cause hypertension, birth problems, and a few other minor problems. However, caffeine and ethanol are both ""not good"" for you in most contexts, and its all about weighing out their potential health risks with whatever value we place on their psychoactive effects. It is absolutely true, though, that cigarettes carry with them a lot of baggage that causes many of the health problems associated with smoking, and the only reason people smoke is because of nicotine, so in that sense it is the ""worst"" thing in a cig. Just to add some primary literature to this, here is an excerpt from Uptodate, which is paid access so you cannot see it. &gt;NICOTINE AND CARDIOVASCULAR RISK — Smoking is an important and established risk for myocardial infarction and other coronary events, including angina pectoris [11-13]. The mechanisms by which cigarette smoking accelerates atherosclerosis and precipitates acute coronary events are complex. The main responsible constituents are combustion products, including oxidizing chemicals, acrolein, butadiene, metals such as cadmium , polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, particulates, and carbon monoxide. Oxidizing chemicals increase free radicals, increase lipid peroxidation, and contribute to several potential mechanisms of cardiovascular disease, including inflammation, endothelial dysfunction, oxidation of LDL, and platelet activation. Nicotine may also contribute to acute coronary events. There are a number of ways in which nicotine can affect the cardiovascular system to increase the risk of atherosclerosis and cardiovascular events such as myocardial infarction Also, wikipedia has alot of this information. Now, your friend may think an e cig is absolutely safe. This is a dubious claim, since, not only does nicotine have some negative side effects, but the current regulations on e cigs are effectively non-existent. This means their may be some other various chemicals that make them unsafe. They are a fairly new thing so research is insufficient. My personal opinion is that they are definitely more safe than cigarettes, less safe than nothing at all, but a potentially excellent smoking cessation therapy option that could get people to stop smoking.",30,0,0,

The Lisbon treaty an undemocratic re-write of the constitution that the Queen was apparently concerned about as well passed the same powers to the EU, and gave it a foreign minister, which puts it heavily on a path to acquire an army to back up its foreign policy. There are loads of federalists in Brussels calling for an EU army anyway, and Clegg's party group mates are among them. Yet Clegg to a UK audience says Farage is a barking mad conspiracy theorist for bringing up an EU army. Dishonest in the extreme. Both here and in the other place lib dems are massively overrepresented compared to the population so criticising Clegg always gets downvotes but I simply don't care, he's one of the most dishonest politicians in modern politics.

Seems to me like it's just a case of the Sun trying to goad some sort of response out of Buckingham Palace that they can call a statement of support for one side or the other. Looking through that article for the origin of the headline, we have this: &gt; The account of the bombshell lunch during the last government - which a handful of other government ministers also attended - has been relayed to The Sun by a highly reliable source. It all rather depends on how much we trust the Sun to be telling the truth about its ""highly reliable source"". It's not exactly convincing, quite frankly. Before I'm prepared to ascribe a political position to such a famously political neutral figure, I'm going to need a lot more than a source without a name that comes with The Sun's word I can trust what I'm seeing. &gt; A Buckingham Palace spokesman said: “The Queen remains politically neutral, as she has for years. We would never comment on spurious, anonymously sourced claims."" Seems entirely reasonable. The Sun are just trying to play the ludicrous justification that because Her Majesty made a very neutral statement in the run up to the Scottish referendum to the effect that voters should ""think very carefully"", that means that &gt;It is now beyond doubt that she made a very careful intervention in the Scottish independence referendum to back a vote for the union. and that therefore &gt;If she has a view on something as big as Brexit, don’t voters have a right to know what it is?

While I believe there will be numerous near-certainties and likely occurrences, these are purely things that will happen.

For this period the UK will be subject to all the laws, but have no vote on them. This will be avoided if: - A qualified majority of remaining member states and a majority of the European Parliament agree and ratify on a settlement. - All remaining member states agree and ratify an extension of this. - Trade deals alone take -10 years or more. Negotiating anything beyond this such as EEA membership or similar would take a similar amount of time. More complex deals would logically take longer. - While these timescales cannot be “known”, a faster negotiation would be record-breaking. - Britain hasn’t negotiated a trade deal for years. We would need time to build up the resources and eertise for negotiation and dealing with trade defence cases. - A shorter example is that of the EEA; it took from to - % of UK GDP is linked to erts to the EU, while only % of other EU member states GDP is linked to erts to the UK. Any proposition that that “they need us more than we need them” and as such the EU will be desperate to give the UK a special deal in rapid time for economic reasons doesn’t hold up. - The simplest free trade deal would be EEA membership. This entails: - Large membership fees - Freedom of movement - Following a vast majority of the laws - All three of these are cited by anti-EU people as reasons to leave in the first place, so I personally doubt this would be seen as a better situation.

reply,d0t65m7,"So I understand the appeal of a unified europe, even to the extent of a federal entity with current nations as states. But what do you feel about the direction that this is going with regard to things like the lack of accountability in elections? For example the US are having a big debate at the moment to decide their new leader. There are a ton of smaller state elections to work out the party nominees and then there will be a national election to work out who the new president is. But in the EU we don't have that. We're just told Junker is the president as voted for by the leaders of each nation. Well why should I trust Cameron to pick the right person? Also why do leaders of nations with a population of a few million get the same say as leaders of nations with a population of over million? Surely something as important as who our president is should be something that the entirety of the EU population should get a say in? And this is something that should have bene built in right at the start, not something that we are aspirationally moving towards. What are your thoughts on this?",3,0,3,
reply,d0t6hfd,"Did you vote for Cameron to become Prime Minister? No, you voted for an MP and he was selected by MPs. This is how the appointment of the EU president is supposed to work too.

Junker is the first time those requirements were enforced. Cameron trying to block Junker was actually an attempt to deny the people of Europe a say in who was president. Also don't forget, everything the EU tries to pass MUST be approved by EU parliament which has proportional representation and Britain due to its population has a gigantic number of MEPs representing it.",5,0,3,
reply,d0u2vle,And that would be fine if Junker were the leader of the largest party of MEPs and campaigned as their leader during the election. That would be transparency. Cameron trying to stop it is as much of a problem as any of the other leaders trying to support it. The point is that these decisions are taken far away from the electorate with zero accountability. I doubt the US population would be happy with their president being selected by all the state governors under the argument that any law has to be passed by the House anyway.

Canada and America have legislatures constrained by written, codified constitutions with human rights codes, and supreme courts with the power to review legislation and strike it down. In the UK, The Crown is the only real constraint on parliamentary tyranny and on tyranny of the majority. The Crown prevents a prime minister from declaring themselves Fuhrer after purging another party. Of course democracy matters, but constitutionalism, rule of law, civil liberties, and a system of checks and balances matter more. If the armed forces sided against The Crown, they would be guilty of perjury. Republicans in Parliament are already guilty of perjury. And even if The Crown exercised real power now, Parliament would still be stronger. Hanoverian Kings exercised deal power daily but were weaker than Parliament.

reply,d0tastm,"No. They are and should be loyal to The Crown. The Rule of Law matters most. It was created to restrain The Crown, and still does. A pity that it doesn't restrain Parliament. Canada and America have legislatures constrained by written, codified constitutions with human rights codes, and supreme courts with the power to review legislation and strike it down. In the UK, The Crown is the only real constraint on parliamentary tyranny and on tyranny of the majority. The Crown prevents a prime minister from declaring themselves Fuhrer after purging another party. Of course democracy matters, but constitutionalism, rule of law, civil liberties, and a system of checks and balances matter more. If the armed forces sided against The Crown, they would be guilty of perjury. Republicans in Parliament are already guilty of perjury. And even if The Crown exercised real power now, Parliament would still be stronger. Hanoverian Kings exercised deal power daily but were weaker than Parliament. Executive Constitutional Monarchy is as viable and stable as Ceremonial Constitutional Monarchy.",1,0,3,

The amount of money a company was planning on donating gets divided up and each employee gets a 'campaign voucher' that they are free to give to any political party of their choosing. The company then petitions their employees on who they'd prefer the donations go to, why that party is better for the company and its employees, etc. And how the policies of that party will enable the company to grow, wages to rise, etc. Ultimately though the donations would be made anonymously by employees entirely at their own discretion after weighing their employer's arguments against their own views. ...Union donations would work in the exact same way.",1,0,3,

reply,dc49ttw,"Lol natural news. On a serious note, even if the % consensus is ""bunk"" the science is not. Edit: I'm going to eand on this a little more and elain why the science is not bunk: Firstly, we know that CO2 traps heat, it is a greenhouse gas just like methane and water vapour. The way these molecules trap heat is easy: they absorb the radiation, keep it then radiate it out in all directions. Other molecules then pick up this radiated heat and the cycles continues. The way this becomes a problem is due to positive feedback, which is a way of saying ""something causes itself"". Heating the atmosphere has another effect, heating up air allows for it to absorb more water vapour and since water vapour is a GHG, yeah you're seeing where this is going. The warmer the atmosphere gets, the more GHG's it can absorb and so on. Now where deniers get this wrong is the whole state of the CO2. Yes plants and trees absorb CO2, the issue is that this cycle aptly named the Carbon Cycle was in equalibium, the amount of CO2 entering the atmosphere was equal to the amount leaving. Now it is not equal, the amount entering the atmosphere is far more than the total biomass can absorb and thus a net increase. I hope this clears up certain myths because the science of climate change is really not difficult to understand.

reply,dkforfa,"You are on the right track. A few additional points : * The bulk of the mass % or more of total mass! that you lift out of the gravity well, is in fact the fuel that you are using to lift you out of the gravity well. This is why rockets use stages, so they can abandon the empty tanks as soon as they are empty. * * See the fuel paradox section of this article * As you said, the moon's gravity is much weaker, and wouldn't take that much to escape /6 of the cost of lifting that same mass from earth. And additionally, we were lifting much less mass from the moon than we lifted from earth * * Added to that, for the actual moon landing, we only took enough fuel to get back into moon-orbit. All the rest of the fuel stayed in orbit around the moon for the trip back to earth. * * all the abandoned rocket stages on earth, all the fuel that had already been spent, the command module in moon orbit, the parts of the Lunar Module we left on the moon, the rover, etc was all mass we didn't have to move around the second time, making the fuel requirements cheaper. * The entire moon journey was in orbit around the earth. It took relatively little fuel to push us towards the moon, and then come back. Notably, had we missed the moon, we would have come back to earth automatically, without eending further fuel although perhaps the astronauts would have run out of air first * * This was used for practical effect in Apollo where they just did a trip around the moon and came back, because if they didn't actually have enough fuel to ""turn around"" at the time that the accident happened * * This type of logic was a major plot point in the book version of the Martian * During the trip to/from , spending additional fuel just gets you there faster, but every bit of fuel you spend speeding you up, you might also have to spend slowing you down again absent using the gravity well for that purpose - so they minimize the amount of fuel the actually use for the trip, and save it mostly for emergencies and course corrections. If it takes you days, or days probably isn't a big deal as long as you planned for it, and the additional cost/weight of the fuel to do it in days less is prohibitive . - So they figure out the acceptable mission length, and take enough fuel for that to work out.",12,0,3,
reply,dkfp7x9,"Thanks so much for your answer! If you have knowledge of the 'ratio' of the fuel necessary to get to the moon i.e. get out of the earth's gravity well vs. the fuel needed to get a much smaller vehicle in and out of the moon-orbit and then back into the earth-orbit that takes it home, that would be very helpful : Thanks for giving me further things to google though!",3,0,3,

For example, *wanderlust* and *delicatessan* we straight up borrow from German, and an ESL speaker whose native language isn't German wouldn't know that. *Answer*, however, is not a borrowed word, but an English word which was introduced to the English lexicon from the Proto-Germanic language. This is because English developed with influence from the Germanic people coming to England hundreds of years ago, notably the Frisians, Sans, and Danes. When they went to England, whether trading or settling, the English language evolved to accommodate. So now you see what I mean? There is German influence from pre-Old English that have Germanic origins from hundreds of years ago, and there are German words that English borrowed very recently without changing or integrating the word.

reply,e2bxdg5,"[Actual quote from President Trump] 9 : &gt; I was opening Turnberry the day before Brexit and all they wanted to talk about was Brexit and I said I think Brexit would happen and it did happen. President Trump [left for the UK on Friday th June] UK time , arrived in Scotland [some time later on Friday th June] - around am - and was [getting ready to open Turnberry] 2 around 0am. No matter how you spin it he didn't open Turnberry the day before Brexit. The guy couldn't remember basic facts. ------- Other gems from the press conference. The whole ""fake news"" for reporting what he said thing, saying ""We left [the Nato] meeting more unified and wealthier as a group than ever before"" - interesting use of ""wealthy"" there. On meeting with President Putin: &gt; We will talk about a number of things: Ukraine, Syria, the Middle East, nuclear proliferation. We are massively modernizing and fixing and buying and it’s just a devastating technology. It is a very bad policy. We have no choice. We are massively big and they are very big and I’ll be talking about nuclear proliferation. On Nato spending: &gt; I say we pay percent of the cost of NATO, which is really there for Europe much more than for us. He can say that, but it isn't true. Based on [a couple] of [sources] the US contributes % of Nato's common fund, and about % of Nato military spending. On immigration, after some classic dog-whistle racism: &gt; It’s not good for Europe and it’s not good for our country. We have very bad immigration laws. We’re doing incredibly well considering we virtually don’t have immigration laws — I don’t even call them laws, you just walk across the border and then you’re tied in a lawsuit for five years. On the UK-US special relationship: &gt; I would give our relationship with the U.K. the highest level of special. Am I allowed to go higher than that? They are very special people, it’s a very special country and my mother was born in Scotland. As far as advice goes, I gave her a suggestion and I think maybe she found it too brutal. I gave her a suggestion, not advice. I can fully understand why she thought it might be tough — if they don’t get the right deal, she may choose to do what I suggested. It’s a disgrace how the EU has taken advantage of the U.S. On Russia invading Ukraine: &gt; President Obama failed very badly with Crimea — I wouldn’t have done that. He took it over during the Obama administration. We’ll have to see what happens ... I’m not bad at doing things. Let’s see what happens. This was an Obama disaster. If I were president, he would not have taken over. On Theresa May: &gt; She will do very well. She is a tough negotiator and a very smart and determined people. On the Russia meeting: &gt; Proliferation, to me, is the biggest problem in the world. I understand nuclear. I used to talk nuclear with my uncle. It is the biggest problem the world has, so if we can do something to reduce them, maybe it’s a dream, but it’s a subject I will bring up with him. I was telling the PM that I’m not going in with high eectations. We have stupidity going on in the U.S. that makes it hard to do something with Russia.

reply,cq6dipq,"&gt;However, scientists do not dig up anything labeled with those ages. They only uncover dead dinosaurs i.e., their bones , and their bones do not have labels attached telling how old they are. The idea of millions of years of evolution is just the evolutionists’ story about the past. No scientist was there to see the dinosaurs live through this supposed dinosaur age. In fact, there is no proof whatsoever that the world and its fossil layers are millions of years old This is simply not true. The main way scientists can date fossils they find is by referring to the [geological strata] in which the fossils were found. The only working elanation for the existence of strata is that they were laid down over millions of years before Darwin, it was actually geologists who first questioned the age of the Earth and the biblical creation myth. By looking at which stratum a fossil was found in, you can get an idea, to the nearest million years or so, when the fossil was formed. You can also use radioactive decay to date certain types of rock found in the same stratum. Carbon dating isn't much good for dinosaur fossils, as it can only date objects younger than about ,000 years, but by looking at the decay of elements with longer half-lives like uranium, you can determine when certain volcanic strata were laid down. If you find a fossil above a stratum you know is million years old, and below a stratum you know is million years old, that fossil must be between and million years old.",6,0,3,
reply,cq6do3d,"&gt;This would mean, of course, that there would have been millions of creatures during that time that would be “in between,” as amphibians evolved into reptiles. Evidence of these “transitional forms,” as they are called, should be abundant. Firstly, no scientist eects fossil evidence to be ""abundant."" [Fossilisation] is something which happens extremely rarely. An organism has to die in quite specific circumstances in order to end up as a fossil, and the vast majority of plants and animals will just decay into nothing. It's only because of the sheer age of the world and the number of organisms that have lived and died that we are able to find so many fossils. But the fossil record is by it's nature incomplete. Secondly, there are plenty of examples of transitional fossils. However, these are also examples of unique species. Any organism discovered which is sufficiently different from other known organisms gets classified as a new species. If we know about Species A and Species C, and we believe Species C to be a descendant of Species A, then we might look for a species which is an ancestor of Species C *and* a descendant of Species A, which we'll call Species B. B would be a ""transitional form"" between A and C. However, the standard response of creationists is then to ask ""Where's the transitional form between A and B?"" Futurama summarised this ""debate"" process [rather well]",6,0,3,

reply,cq6fj7f,"The others have given good answers, and I would like to add to the mix. But over and above that, a little rational thought might be an interesting place to work from. Consider the following train of thought: There are a hell of a lot of people involved in the sciences. Everything from medical research to physics to geology to orbital mechanics to engineering and materials, etc. A subset of these people are involved in Paleontology, but relevantly their work _overlaps_ with these other sciences. Radiometric dating overlaps with nuclear physics. Strata dating overlaps with geology. Our understanding of fossilisation comes from our understandings of chemistry and biology. All of these other disciplines are tested by the fact that we _use_ them. We use geology to find oils and minerals and predict the weather and choose where to build huge buildings. We use biology and chemistry in a huge range of applications, from chemical engineering to antibiotics to heart transplants to modern crop farming. We have nuclear reactors that have been churning out predicable power for decades, and satellites serving our communications, and millions of aeroplanes safely running about the skies. We have cellphones. All of the above are using exactly the same understandings about the world that paleontologists use to date dinosaur bones and evolutionary scientists use to understand the development of modern species. It's all the same mechanics, just a slightly different application. To say that the knowledge is somehow wrong is like saying that a man who is an excellent driver of a four-door sedan can in no way know _anything_ about driving a hatchback. So, this leads us to one of three conclusions. Either... a We're somehow wrong about how everything works, and all the stuff we've managed to do is sheer luck that it works, despite our misunderstanding. b It's all a giant 'evolutionist' conspiracy, one that would have to involve so many people that it would be almost a majority of the population at least, the population with power and influence . The point of such a conspiracy would be unclear, since I can't see a real reward. c The bible literalists are wrong. Personally, I'm leaning towards 'c' as the most likely answer.",6,0,3,

reply,d1rfaf8,"Its easiest to debunk by reading the actual article. The website refers to this study: . The paragraph on fluoride reads: ""A meta-analysis of cross-sectional studies of children eed to fluoride in drinking water, mainly from China, suggests an average IQ decrement of about seven points in children eed to raised fluoride concentrations.44 Confounding from other substances seemed unlikely in most of these studies. Further characterisation of the dose–response association would be desirable."" If you click on the reference , it takes you to the PubMed citation for the source of that meta-analysis, and at the bottom of that citation is an exchange between skeptics and the authors again, more links . Here is selected text from the skeptics :""Even if we ignore the weaknesses of the study Choi et al. , including a lack of individual-level information and the high probability of confounding because the authors did not adjust for covariates, a difference of in mean IQ is clinically negligible Jeckel et al. ; Rothman et al. ; Szklo and Nieto even though it was statistically significant."" So the article on the website makes a big deal about paragraph in a review article Level evidence, by the way , which refers to a meta-analysis Level evidence . The biggest issue with the meta-analysis is really that it found a -point drop in IQ, which as the skeptics point out, is clinically negligible even if it is statistically significant. TLR: The Lancet did not declare fluoride a neurotoxin, they published an opinion piece where the authors noted a potential link between fluoride eure and IQ not dyslexia and ADHD . The data supporting this link suggest a statistically significant, but clinical unimportant, effect. Debunked.",8,0,3,

reply,d23k9ry,"One thing ""scare articles"" seldom mention is that fluoridation programs sometimes remove fluoride instead of adding it. The whole thing came about as a result of a condition called ""texas teeth"". Folks in some areas developed unsightly brown stains on their teeth, but those same stained chompers showed marked decreases in decay. The cause was the naturally occurring high level of fluoride in the water. Research was done to find a happy medium between strong teeth and brown ones, and a sort of national standard was picked. So in some spots the water treatment includes *removing it* instead of adding it. Shutting down all fluoridation treatment would also shut down this protection. I'm sure in high enough doses you could hurt yourself with fluoride. At high enough doses you can hurt yourself with water. However even if you're drinking water from an unregulated well in an area with high natural fluoride in it you're unlikely to be harmed by it. My mother was a little girl in England in the aftermath of WWII when fluoride simply wasn't available. My aunt lost all her teeth as a teenager. My mother kept hers but doesn't have one without serious dental work in it. Mine aren't perfect but a LONG way from either of those scenarios. My childhood was soaked in fluoride, both from school ""treatment"" programs and at home in the form of toothpastes. I may be a bit nerdy but I don't think I've suffered neurological trauma from it.",1,0,3,

We have the co2 records going back millions of years, from measuring trapped air bubbles in stone. We've seen co2 get really high, then get lower as plants sequestered it as hydrocarbons. It's all over the place. So it isn't really relevant to ask what the co2 output of a volcano is, because it never really had enough of an impact historically to really be a relevant factor. I.

reply,dz1pccl,Deportation is the outcome that should apply to those who willingly overstay their visas in an effort to violate U.S. immigration laws. Does this make them criminals? It does to the extent they have broken the nation's immigration laws with malice of forethought. You are most definitely engaging in legalistic hairsplitting with that argument. It is both disingenuous and fraudulent. Crime and criminals are defined by law violations. Your argument rests solely on the penalties that result from that law-breaking while ignoring the law violation entirely. That's what makes it so disingenuous.,1,0,3,

reply,dz02b9f,"I read them. Your first quote describes the feelings and opinions that first generation youth have toward the legal system it states nothing about actual crime rate . Your second quote is taken from the 'Objective' section of the research article which serves to provide context for the current research being performed , here the author is stating a claim, in this case he is citing his own research in the study, this is not the conclusion statement of the research article. All these studies were of youth who had already committed a crime, so more of a study in recidivism, not crime rate across whole populations. [Here] is the actual, full Migration Letters study that is cited in the news article. From p. Discussion my commentary in brackets : First, consistent with previous research, self -reported offending prior to engagement with the justice system i.e., first arrest is relatively and consistently low for immigrants generally and for undocumented immigrants specifically compared to their US -born peers. [immigrants and undocumented immigrants self reported that they committed fewer crimes compared to whites in their initial interviews, whoa guess we'll take their word on that; not like there isn't rampant evidence that victims in immigrants neighborhoods are less likely to go to the cops fewer victims come forward, fewer arrests made ; see my previous posts in another parent thread ] Second, compared to their documented immigrant and US -born peers, undocumented immigrants continue to report low levels of offending in the three -years following first arrest. [undocumented immigrants in the follow up interviews self -reported that they are committing fewer crimes; of course they would, they fear deportation ] Third, and in contrast to the findings for self -reported offending, undocumented immigrants are more likely to be re -arrested and are re -arrested more in the three -years following their first arrest. Differences in the risk of re -arrest appear to be most pronounced immediately following their first arrest. [hang on, now the study is looking at actual arrests, which reveal undocumented immigrants were lying in their interviews, maybe the self -reported evidence isn't so robust? ]",0,0,3,
reply,dz08rnx,"Nothing about ""feelings and opinions"" in the ABSTRACT. Not sure why you keep hammering that. You are implying these supposed thoughts and feelings. In fact, i'm not quite sure why asking undocumented immigrants if they've been arrested counts as ""thoughts and feelings"", and why it is *bad* to ask undocumented immigrants about their past. To reiterate, the premise of your argument, ie ""this is all just a bunch of thoughts and feelings"", in reality, are researchers asking specific questions about their eeriences with criminal behavior etc. That is actually a valid approach in determining if someone has been arrested, you know, by simply asking them if they've been arrested or involved in criminal behavior. Not only do they ask fact -based questions, researchers also do what is called ""cross referencing"", in that they look up judicial records to VERIFY what they've been told. In the link you posted, this is an excerpt from the ABSTRACT: &gt;""Results suggest that, as compared to documented immigrants and US -born peers, undocumented immigrants report engaging in less crime prior to and following their first arrest"" Another excerpt from the CONCLUSION: &gt;""Justification for heightened immigration enforcement and the criminalization of immigration law is based on the assertion that undocumented immigrants represent a distinctly dangerous class. With this research, we **add to the limited knowledge base** and **investigate crime** among those lacking legal US residency **by assessing patterns of offending longitudinally, both prior to and following first arrest, using self -reported offending and officially recorded arrest measures.**"" So what exactly is wrong with their methodology again?

reply,dyyt4za,"... Really? OK: thought eeriment: &gt;Not all Immigrants. &gt;It’s the phrase we hear time and time again, albeit in a very narrow set of circumstances. It’s never used, for example, when immigrant commentators opine on how immigrants are better cooks than locals, or immigrants are great at dancing. &gt;*insert your own tired stereotype here*. &gt;No, for some reason, those that screech ! never seem to take issue with those such generalisations or sweeping statements. &gt;But when locals talk about sexual violence and harassment, as they have done in their droves since the influx of migrants and allegations of sexual assault in Cologne came to light, you can bet your bottom dollar that immigrants will queue up to take issue with it. &gt;Here’s how it usually goes: &gt;Local: I’ve been shouted at in the street, groped in nightclubs, assaulted on the tube and was raped by an Arab. &gt;Immigrant: Actually, I think it’s important to make clear that not all immigrants are like this. Most immigrants would never behave in such a terrible way. I certainly wouldn’t. Isn’t it a bit racist to tar all immigrants with the same brush? &gt;Well, actually… &gt; The brigade don’t sincerely think that locals talking about the violence we’ve been subjected to at the hands of immigrants are under the impression that every single immigrant on the planet has behaved in a similar way. &gt;That would be, well, a bit silly. &gt; If nearly every local you know has faced sexual violence or harassment in one form or another throughout her life, then us asking why ‘’immigrants’’ continue to perpetuate this culture, shouldn’t be controversial. &gt; Yes, we KNOW that not every single immigrant is responsible. Yes, we KNOW that you would never do that; and you’ve reminded us enough, thanks. &gt; So doesn’t clarify anything. It doesn’t add to the discussion or develop it in any way. All it does is derail and dismiss the lived eeriences of locals And what the immigrants who leap to remind us that ‘’not all immigrants are like that’’, are actually saying is, ‘’I’m not like that.’’ Or to put it another way, they are letting locals know that discussing racism makes them uncomfortable, and they’d like to be absolved of any blame before they will let the locals continue. &gt; Locals undertook massive amounts of emotional labour and relived personal trauma in sharing their stories of sexual violence on . To ask us to hand out cookies and ‘Well Done For Not Raping Anybody’ badges to immigrants who rush to tell us , is unreasonable at best, and insulting at worst. &gt; If you are an immigrant and don’t recognise yourself in the behaviour described by locals recently, then great. Our discussion of it shouldn’t offend you, or put you on edge. The immigrants who are behaving like allies in this are the ones that are amplifying local’s voices, examining their own behaviour, and not drowning out our conversations in search of praise or validation. I can continue, if you want. Reads like an alt-right piece of propaganda. **You. Are. Using. The. Exact. Same. Logic. And. Reasoning.** And it's fundamentally flawed. The reason people say is because it is inherently hurtful to even assume that a wide-range of the male population is part of this. We aren't. We aren't the assholes who grope you. We aren't the assholes who rape you. I'm not saying that in search of validation, as the article states that I am, but because it flat out slanderous, and degrading. My very identity as a man is being associated with something that it just isn't. And as the alt-right uses these rhetorical tools against immigrants, brown people, Muslims, blacks, whatever the fuck, so you are using these **exact same rhetorical tools** to attack men, and then you hide behind the ""oh, but we don't **really** mean all men."" Change the way you talk about the issue, and all is forgotten. Some men. A minority of men. A sub-population of men. Certain kinds of men. Whatever the fuck you want as a pre-fix men. But not all men. You're turning via your use of language individuals, lots of individuals, into a monolith, something that you'd never accept for any other group. And on a side-note: the ""lived eeriences"" part is worth nothing. It's about stats. Stats allow us to make effective changes and policy. And the stats are clear: many women suffer from sexual harassment, assault or rape, and we need to do something about that. But I don't care about ""lived eeriences"", because they are inherently subjective and tainted in bias. We all fall prey to bias. Alt-righters have their world view warped by their bias to elevate their whiteness to a position of superiority. Their lived eeriences have taught them that all black people are criminals and dangerous thugs. Lived eeriences are never a good argument when formulating policy. I won't throw out lived eeriences when talking to individuals, of course. I'll listen. I'll be as supportive as I can. But I need grand-scale statistical data to talk about what needs to be done. This is exactly what I was referring to. The exact same logic is used by certain feminists to justify rhetorically putting all men in the same basket. And we not only don't deserve it, I, personally, will defend my character and identity, which is under attack when AllMen is used.",-1,0,3,

reply,dyyt4za,"... Really? OK: thought eeriment: &gt;Not all Immigrants. &gt;It’s the phrase we hear time and time again, albeit in a very narrow set of circumstances. It’s never used, for example, when immigrant commentators opine on how immigrants are better cooks than locals, or immigrants are great at dancing. &gt;*insert your own tired stereotype here*. &gt;No, for some reason, those that screech ! never seem to take issue with those such generalisations or sweeping statements. &gt;But when locals talk about sexual violence and harassment, as they have done in their droves since the influx of migrants and allegations of sexual assault in Cologne came to light, you can bet your bottom dollar that immigrants will queue up to take issue with it. &gt;Here’s how it usually goes: &gt;Local: I’ve been shouted at in the street, groped in nightclubs, assaulted on the tube and was raped by an Arab. &gt;Immigrant: Actually, I think it’s important to make clear that not all immigrants are like this. Most immigrants would never behave in such a terrible way. I certainly wouldn’t. Isn’t it a bit racist to tar all immigrants with the same brush? &gt;Well, actually… &gt; The brigade don’t sincerely think that locals talking about the violence we’ve been subjected to at the hands of immigrants are under the impression that every single immigrant on the planet has behaved in a similar way. &gt;That would be, well, a bit silly. &gt; If nearly every local you know has faced sexual violence or harassment in one form or another throughout her life, then us asking why ‘’immigrants’’ continue to perpetuate this culture, shouldn’t be controversial. &gt; Yes, we KNOW that not every single immigrant is responsible. Yes, we KNOW that you would never do that; and you’ve reminded us enough, thanks. &gt; So doesn’t clarify anything. It doesn’t add to the discussion or develop it in any way. All it does is derail and dismiss the lived eeriences of locals And what the immigrants who leap to remind us that ‘’not all immigrants are like that’’, are actually saying is, ‘’I’m not like that.’’ Or to put it another way, they are letting locals know that discussing racism makes them uncomfortable, and they’d like to be absolved of any blame before they will let the locals continue. &gt; Locals undertook massive amounts of emotional labour and relived personal trauma in sharing their stories of sexual violence on . To ask us to hand out cookies and ‘Well Done For Not Raping Anybody’ badges to immigrants who rush to tell us , is unreasonable at best, and insulting at worst. &gt; If you are an immigrant and don’t recognise yourself in the behaviour described by locals recently, then great. Our discussion of it shouldn’t offend you, or put you on edge. The immigrants who are behaving like allies in this are the ones that are amplifying local’s voices, examining their own behaviour, and not drowning out our conversations in search of praise or validation. I can continue, if you want. Reads like an alt-right piece of propaganda. **You. Are. Using. The. Exact. Same. Logic. And. Reasoning.** And it's fundamentally flawed. The reason people say is because it is inherently hurtful to even assume that a wide-range of the male population is part of this. We aren't. We aren't the assholes who grope you. We aren't the assholes who rape you. I'm not saying that in search of validation, as the article states that I am, but because it flat out slanderous, and degrading. My very identity as a man is being associated with something that it just isn't. And as the alt-right uses these rhetorical tools against immigrants, brown people, Muslims, blacks, whatever the fuck, so you are using these **exact same rhetorical tools** to attack men, and then you hide behind the ""oh, but we don't **really** mean all men."" Change the way you talk about the issue, and all is forgotten. Some men. A minority of men. A sub-population of men. Certain kinds of men. Whatever the fuck you want as a pre-fix men. But not all men. You're turning via your use of language individuals, lots of individuals, into a monolith, something that you'd never accept for any other group. And on a side-note: the ""lived eeriences"" part is worth nothing. It's about stats. Stats allow us to make effective changes and policy. And the stats are clear: many women suffer from sexual harassment, assault or rape, and we need to do something about that. But I don't care about ""lived eeriences"", because they are inherently subjective and tainted in bias. We all fall prey to bias. Alt-righters have their world view warped by their bias to elevate their whiteness to a position of superiority. Their lived eeriences have taught them that all black people are criminals and dangerous thugs. Lived eeriences are never a good argument when formulating policy. I won't throw out lived eeriences when talking to individuals, of course. I'll listen. I'll be as supportive as I can. But I need grand-scale statistical data to talk about what needs to be done.

""Mounting evidence reveals that foreign-born, first generation immigrants have significantly lower levels of criminal involvement compared to their US-born, second and third-plus generation peers.""

reply,dz02b9f,"I read them. Your first quote describes the feelings and opinions that first generation youth have toward the legal system it states nothing about actual crime rate . Your second quote is taken from the 'Objective' section of the research article which serves to provide context for the current research being performed , here the author is stating a claim, in this case he is citing his own research in the study, this is not the conclusion statement of the research article. All these studies were of youth who had already committed a crime, so more of a study in recidivism, not crime rate across whole populations. [Here] is the actual, full Migration Letters study that is cited in the news article. From p. Discussion my commentary in brackets : First, consistent with previous research, self -reported offending prior to engagement with the justice system i.e., first arrest is relatively and consistently low for immigrants generally and for undocumented immigrants specifically compared to their US -born peers. [immigrants and undocumented immigrants self reported that they committed fewer crimes compared to whites in their initial interviews, whoa guess we'll take their word on that; not like there isn't rampant evidence that victims in immigrants neighborhoods are less likely to go to the cops fewer victims come forward, fewer arrests made ; see my previous posts in another parent thread ] Second, compared to their documented immigrant and US -born peers, undocumented immigrants continue to report low levels of offending in the three -years following first arrest. [undocumented immigrants in the follow up interviews self -reported that they are committing fewer crimes; of course they would, they fear deportation ] Third, and in contrast to the findings for self -reported offending, undocumented immigrants are more likely to be re -arrested and are re -arrested more in the three -years following their first arrest. Differences in the risk of re -arrest appear to be most pronounced immediately following their first arrest. [hang on, now the study is looking at actual arrests, which reveal undocumented immigrants were lying in their interviews, maybe the self -reported evidence isn't so robust? ]",0,0,3,
reply,dz08rnx,"Nothing about ""feelings and opinions"" in the ABSTRACT. Not sure why you keep hammering that. You are implying these supposed thoughts and feelings. In fact, i'm not quite sure why asking undocumented immigrants if they've been arrested counts as ""thoughts and feelings"", and why it is *bad* to ask undocumented immigrants about their past. To reiterate, the premise of your argument, ie ""this is all just a bunch of thoughts and feelings"", in reality, are researchers asking specific questions about their eeriences with criminal behavior etc. That is actually a valid approach in determining if someone has been arrested, you know, by simply asking them if they've been arrested or involved in criminal behavior. Not only do they ask fact -based questions, researchers also do what is called ""cross referencing"", in that they look up judicial records to VERIFY what they've been told. In the link you posted, this is an excerpt from the ABSTRACT: &gt;""Results suggest that, as compared to documented immigrants and US -born peers, undocumented immigrants report engaging in less crime prior to and following their first arrest"" Another excerpt from the CONCLUSION: &gt;""Justification for heightened immigration enforcement and the criminalization of immigration law is based on the assertion that undocumented immigrants represent a distinctly dangerous class. With this research, we **add to the limited knowledge base** and **investigate crime** among those lacking legal US residency **by assessing patterns of offending longitudinally, both prior to and following first arrest, using self -reported offending and officially recorded arrest measures.**"" So what exactly is wrong with their methodology again?

The Southern Poverty Law Center SPLC published reports in and connecting CIS to John Tanton, who helped found various other organizations, including the Federation for American Immigration Reform FAIR and NumbersUSA, and showing he has ties to white supremacy groups and a eugenics foundation SPLC . Bottom line, this is a hate group. /8/2017 Speaking from an outside perspective UK The SPLC has done it's due dilligence in this matter, from the politifact link alone I would agree with their sentiment. Your problem is that you are ignoring the fact that conservwtive views Are being espoused by the alt-right and neo-nazi/KKK crowd, after all david duke endorsed trump, the alt-right and tge neo-nazis and the KKK follow a conservative ideology and believe that conservative policy will bring about their version of the U.S the 's social mess, pre suffrage or civil rights movement or a white ethnostate, with P.O.C and minorites eelled or enslaved .

Your second quote is taken from the 'Objective' section of the research article which serves to provide context for the current research being performed , here the author is stating a claim, in this case he is citing his own research in the study, this is not the conclusion statement of the research article. All these studies were of youth who had already committed a crime, so more of a study in recidivism, not crime rate across whole populations. [Here] is the actual, full Migration Letters study that is cited in the news article. From p. Discussion my commentary in brackets : First, consistent with previous research, self -reported offending prior to engagement with the justice system i.e., first arrest is relatively and consistently low for immigrants generally and for undocumented immigrants specifically compared to their US -born peers. [immigrants and undocumented immigrants self reported that they committed fewer crimes compared to whites in their initial interviews, whoa guess we'll take their word on that; not like there isn't rampant evidence that victims in immigrants neighborhoods are less likely to go to the cops fewer victims come forward, fewer arrests made ; see my previous posts in another parent thread ] Second, compared to their documented immigrant and US -born peers, undocumented immigrants continue to report low levels of offending in the three -years following first arrest. [undocumented immigrants in the follow up interviews self -reported that they are committing fewer crimes; of course they would, they fear deportation ] Third, and in contrast to the findings for self -reported offending, undocumented immigrants are more likely to be re -arrested and are re -arrested more in the three -years following their first arrest. Differences in the risk of re -arrest appear to be most pronounced immediately following their first arrest. [hang on, now the study is looking at actual arrests, which reveal undocumented immigrants were lying in their interviews, maybe the self -reported evidence isn't so robust? ]",0,0,3,

There is only one natural source of DHA: algae, and fish that eat algae. Walnuts, flax seeds, etc are NOT DHA. Many people, especially males and older people, do not convert food sources of ALA to DHA very efficiently. In these cases the body will incorporate nonDHA fatty acids into the membrane of the brain.
