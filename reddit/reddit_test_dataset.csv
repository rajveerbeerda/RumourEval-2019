Parental reports were more accurate indicators of the presence of additives than clinical tests.[19] Several major studies show academic performance increased and disciplinary problems decreased in large non-ADD student populations when artificial ingredients, including artificial colors, were eliminated from school food programs.[20][21]"" There is some scientific validity to what she is saying.

reply,cf99p9d,"tlr, the only known affect of non-ionizing radiation is heating. It's not linked to cancer the way ionizing radiation is. Cellphones emit non-ionizing radiation only. In fact, the radiation emitted by a cellphone is generally between cm and cm. Whereas light needs to be at around nm to do damage, or around million times more energetic. They have to be this weak in order to be useful, only visible light and radio waves can punch through the atmosphere. For comparison, visible light ranges from -350nm, and we receive far more of it and radio waves from the sun than from our cellphones.",23,0
reply,cf9ah9w,"An initial problem with the article is the use of the blanket term 'radiation'. It's a nice scary word in a world terrified by nuclear weapons and power plant meltdowns, but it's a bit like saying 'food will make you fat!'. What kind of food? How much? How often? Does simply walking into your kitchen immediately turn you into a balloon? What about if you eat a few biscuits a day? A week? A number of different organisations have studied the potential dangers of cellphone emissions, and the results have been indecisive at best. As for the suggestions... well, they're functionally reasonable if one assumes that one's phone is in fact dangerously radioactive, but they render the phone barely usable. Might as well add: Submerge the phone in the center of a swimming pool. Water is very resistant to many forms of radiation, and this approach is used by all nuclear power plants to control radiation.",13,0

Because it is somehow understood with that, but not cell phones, microwaves, or tvs, that radiation is the act of giving off a form of energy. the way YOU RADIATE HEAT every day, or lightbulbs RADIATE light upon you.

reply,d22gr7t,"I can't believe people are missing the two obvious flaws in this analysis. This infographic doesn't show that companies control % of the media. It doesn't provide any basis for the % figure. That's just a number pulled out of the air. All it shows is that companies create and/or distribute a lot of media content. There are other problems, too. I will update this when I get a few minutes to eand on it. EDIT: Ok, let's elore why this graphic is partly true, partly false and partly misleading. This isn't a comprehensive examination, just a look at some problems that stood out to me. &gt; *“Media has never been more consolidated. media giants now control a staggering % of what we read, watch or listen to.”* The most fundamental problem is here. They give the numerator the media giants and the media they create or distribute , but never give the denominator the total amount of media Americans consume . In fact, the infographic seems to suggest that it is basically just comparing ownership of the largest media outlets in to ownership of those same outlets today....as if media consumption today is, apart from ownership, the same as it was in . *&gt; ""232 Media executives control the information diet of million Americans""* Where do these numbers come from? How does he arrive at media executives? What constitutes ""executive"" or ""control"" or an executive with control? The infographic does not elain. These are just numbers thrown out without any context or apparent methodology. The infographic says the Comcast/NBC merger guarantees ""monopoly of US markets like NYC and Chicago."" I have no idea what that is even supposed to mean. Comcast is not the only provider in NYC or Chicago, and NBCUniversal was not the only cable channel/content producer/network, so in what sense did the merger create a ""monopoly"" in markets? *&gt; ""In , the FCC forbade companies ownership of more than stations. Clear Channel Communications now owns over ,500.""* In , Congress updated the Communications Act and eased ownership restrictions. As a result, some companies started buying a lot of radio stations. Many of those companies are now struggling to stay afloat, because radio audiences have cratered due to the rise of things like the iPod, satellite radio and the Internet. But, you argue, maybe radio would be doing better if it was still locally owned instead of owned by big chains. That's a valid hypothesis. Unfortunately, locally owned and operated radio stations are not doing particularly well, either. The entire industry is struggling. The ability to achieve economies of scale has helped many radio stations that would otherwise be even further underwater. This benefit, however, is balanced against the tremendous debt burden that ClearChannel and other big companies took on when buying up stations. In any event, ""80% of stations' playlists match"" because people are mostly the same everywhere. As etic as those yankees/southerners/west coasters/midwesterners/people from Florida may seem to us, folks in other parts of the United States really aren't *all* that different. Well, maybe people from Florida are, but the rest of us are pretty similar. There are some differences, which is why some areas have more country/rap/alternative/jazz/classical stations than others, but people who like classic rock mostly like the same bands and songs. People who like top mostly like the same bands and songs. Radio stations do extensive audience testing to determine their playlists, to measure what songs are getting ""burned"" and what songs audiences like or might like . There are some regional differences, but people mostly like the same things. People in radio often hear outsiders who are certain they know what the station should do differently -- more new music, more variety, whatever -- and, frankly, many radio people would prefer their stations had more variety and were more inventive. But you know what? They also realize that what people say they want and what people *actually listen to* are two pretty different things. If ""more new music/more variety"" worked consistently, radio stations would do that, because money. *&gt; ""The Big Six's box office sales hit $7 billion in , that's X the box office sales of the next Studios*"" Wait, earlier the infographic were talking about how a few media giants ""control"" the media by owning everything. But this is a different claim. This claims that the few media giants are just *more successful* than ""the next studios"". If there are studios, then it sounds like there's a lot of competition to produce content and people just prefer the content produced by the ""Big ""....or, in reality, produced by one of many, many other studios and bought by the ""Big "" for distribution. And finally, the infographic closes with this dire warning: ""Until regulations return or they buy each other out of existence , they will continue to control % of everything Americans see, hear and consider important."" Sounds serious, right? Now consider what some of the ""media consolidation"" Pollyanna's [were saying years ago] . &gt; ""The Internet has not yet evolved into a ubiquitous mass communications medium that can challenge the other media."" Yeah? How are those radio stations, newspapers and magazines holding up these days? &gt; ""The increasing concentration of the Internet is stunning. AOL's dominance of subscribership in the U.S. is widely noted ... Even more striking is the growth in the concentration of usage. Because the number of potential online channels is infinite, some assume that market dominance is an impossibility on the Internet. This is faulty reasoning. ... Analysis of Media Metrix data over the past three years shows an incontrovertible trend toward online media consolidation…. Between March and March , the total number of companies controlling percent of user minutes online decreased by nearly two-thirds, from to four. Because AOL has such a dominant position over percent of user time the HHI is about , well above the moderately concentrated threshold. The four firm concentration ratio also falls in the range where concerns about concentration and the abuse of market power begin. Yes, years ago they were Deeply Concerned that a few companies, mainly AOL, would ""control"" online media. Shortly thereafter, AOL collapsed, Google and Facebook rose and every asshole with a Twitter account became their own media provider. There are big media companies. There always have been. We'll be fine. In the meantime, giving government more power over the media will not make things better.",7,0

There's no doubt that Google can afford YouTube."" McMahon also believes that by keeping quiet about YouTube's hidden benefits and by allowing the misconception of it as a deeply unprofitable business to circulate, things work very nicely in Google's favour when it comes to negotiating with copyright holders in the world of TV, movies and music. Copyright holders can't demand money that isn't there, and it would certainly take no more than a hint of profitability at YouTube for lawyers to descend, threatening court cases and demanding higher royalties. In the new, topsy-turvy world of online economics, it seems astonishing that losses on paper have actually made YouTube a more powerful online force. This leaves out another point as well: the more that people believe YouTube is unprofitable, the less likely they are to build serious competitors. I have no idea whether or not YouTube is actually profitable directly yet I'd doubt it , but I think those who are insisting that the acquisition by Google was a bad idea, or that YouTube is somehow on its deathbed, haven't taken much time to understand some basic trendlines or the larger picture of how Google views YouTube, and the opportunities it has to make money via YouTube down the road.",1,0

And Ailes the former CEO had even stated in an interview that he did not view CNN and NBC as competitors but ESPN and TNT.

There is a value in keeping things the same. It's not a monetary or ethical value so it's hard to argue for - it's just that there's something fundamentally pleasant, comforting and enriching about having a street name remain the same for hundreds of years. It's not a big value, at least not individually - no-one is eeriencing ecstasy from the mere knowledge that that statue in the park has been there for ages and memorialises someone important, but if you add up all the millions of tiny bits of niceness this produces it's actually quite important, I think. Sometimes there's a good reason to change a name or pull down a statue or make other changes. Actually they happen all the time. But this is a really shit reason, because naming something after someone or having a statue of them doesn't mean you approve of everything they did or believed. Not even remotely. This is such a weird misunderstanding that I find it hard to understand. But the problem is that it's a seductive argument: so-and-so did something bad, so we shouldn't honour them. And changing this name isn't such a big deal so why not do it? ""Eh"" everybody says, ""I guess that *is* bad, and I guess it *isn't* such a big deal. So who cares?""

It's one of the faster growing attack vectors in recent years. If you don't run an ad blocker and disable third party domain scripts / frames by default these days, it's increasingly likely you will be or have already been eed to malware. It's exactly like fucking around without a condom, sooner or later you'll get the digital clap. Many users also never even realise they've been compromised unless the payload is intentionally overt in nature, such as ransomware. Spyware, RATs / trojans, miners and botnet clients only have any benefit to the attacker when they hide their processes from the user. Sure, going to warez and porn sites obviously increases the risk but there's no such thing as ""safe sites"" to stick to. The vast majority of online businesses who deploy adverts contract it out entirely to agencies who often totally fail to do any serious due diligence on the specific content they are serving up to their clients. And that's the agencies which aren't outright malicious themselves. The only realistic solution is for more people to buy subs from outlets they want to support, I have several myself.

There is a value in keeping things the same. It's not a monetary or ethical value so it's hard to argue for - it's just that there's something fundamentally pleasant, comforting and enriching about having a street name remain the same for hundreds of years. It's not a big value, at least not individually - no-one is eeriencing ecstasy from the mere knowledge that that statue in the park has been there for ages and memorialises someone important, but if you add up all the millions of tiny bits of niceness this produces it's actually quite important, I think. Sometimes there's a good reason to change a name or pull down a statue or make other changes. Actually they happen all the time. But this is a really shit reason, because naming something after someone or having a statue of them doesn't mean you approve of everything they did or believed. Not even remotely. This is such a weird misunderstanding that I find it hard to understand. But the problem is that it's a seductive argument: so-and-so did something bad, so we shouldn't honour them.

On another trip I made friends with this Russian dancer who was working in Hurghada for a few months I think, and he had some buddy whos family owned a pub which was closed for renovations, but it was beach-side, so he drove us there in the morning and we watched the sunrise on a completely empty and private beach, smoking a J - it was fucking beautiful.
